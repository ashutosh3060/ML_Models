There are 3 types of recommender systems.
1. collaborative filtering methods (model based & memory based)
2. content based methods
3. Hybrid method (Mix content based and collaborative approaches)

Collaborative filtering methods.
2 sub-categories are: 1. memory based approach   2. model based approach
Advantage:
they require no information about users or items.
Disadvantages:
Suffers from 'cold start problem'
memory based approach - 1. user-user, 2. item-item
model based approach - matrix factorisation

Content based methods.
It uses additional information about users and/or items
Advantage:
Have the information regarding users and items, we can predict for new users or items.
Disadvantage:
Only new users or items with previously unseen features will logically suffer from this drawback.

* In memory based collaborative methods, no latent model is assumed. These methods have low bias but high variance.
* In model based methods, some latent interaction model is assumed. This method has high bias and low variance due to user-item interactions are assumed. 

* In content based method, some latent interaction model is assumed. This method has highest bias but the lowest variance, due to represntations for user-items are given.
