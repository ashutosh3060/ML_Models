There are 3 types of recommender systems.
1. collaborative filtering methods (model based & memory based)
2. content based methods
3. Hybrid method (Mix content based and collaborative approaches)

Collaborative filtering methods.
2 sub-categories are: 1. memory based approach   2. model based approach
Advantage:
they require no information about users or items.
Disadvantages:
Suffers from 'cold start problem'
memory based approach - 1. user-user, 2. item-item
model based approach - matrix factorisation

Content based methods.
It uses additional information about users and/or items
Advantage:
Have the information regarding users and items, we can predict for new users or items.
Disadvantage:
Only new users or items with previously unseen features will logically suffer from this drawback.

* In memory based collaborative methods, no latent model is assumed. These methods have low bias but high variance.
* In model based methods, some latent interaction model is assumed. This method has high bias and low variance due to user-item interactions are assumed. 

* In content based method, some latent interaction model is assumed. This method has highest bias but the lowest variance, due to represntations for user-items are given.

** Memory based Collaborative approach:
User - User method - 
1. It tries to find users with most similar "interactions profile" (nearest neighbours) in order to suggest items that are the most popular among these neighbours (and that are “new” to the user).
2. It is user-centred
3. Find k nearest neighbours of this user in the matrix, recommend the most popular or highly rated items among the neighbours.

Item - Item method - 
1. It tries to find items similar to the ones the user already “positively” interacted with. Two items are considered to be similar if most of the users that have interacted with both of them did it in a similar way.
2. This method is said to be item-centred.
3. Find k nearest neighbours of this item in the matrix, recommend the most popular or highly rated items among the neighbours to the selected “best item” that are new to our user of interest and recommend these items.
4. Instead of only choosing the most favourite item of the user, we can choose the n preffered items instead.
