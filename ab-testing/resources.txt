Q: What is DOE ?
Ans: DOE stands for Design of Experiments.

Q: What can we achieve through A/B testing ?
1. acquire new customers
2. increase sales from existing customers
3. maximize ROI on marketing campaign
4. design new products and services
5. optimize operations among other things

Q: What is full - factorial ?
Ans: If a factor A has m-levels and factor B has n-levels, then by following full-factorial, we need to have m*n treatments or experiments.

Q: Fractional Factorial Design (FFD)
Ans: Only a fraction or portion of combinations are run. e.g. A Half Factorial Design with a 3 factors and 2 levels will have 2^3/2 = 8/2 = 4. Best way to choose these 4 experiments is Balanced Factorial Design.

Q: What are confounding and aliasing in fractional factorial design (FFD)  ?
Ans:
